## Worker

Purpose

- Background processor that leases tasks from `queues.task` and dispatches by `task_type`.

Philosophy

- Supervisors in Postgres decide what to do and when; the worker only executes.
- Keep the worker minimal and generic: lease work, invoke database handlers, and call providers. All scheduling and retries live in SQL.
- This ensures idempotency (derived from facts) and reduces coupling: swapping providers or adding processes doesnâ€™t require worker orchestration changes.
