## Observability and Logging

Purpose

- Provide consistent, structured logs across services with request correlation, and ship logs to Datadog using container labels.

Conventions

- Structured JSON logs via `shared/logger` across Go services (`gateway`, `files`, `worker`). Fields include:
  - `timestamp`, `level`, `service`, optional `request_id`, `message`, optional `error`, and context fields.
- Request correlation:
  - `caddy` generates `X-Request-ID` per request.
  - `shared/middleware.RequestIDMiddleware` propagates it into the request context and logs it on request start/end and subsequent logs in handlers.

Datadog log collection

- `docker-compose.yaml` sets `com.datadoghq.ad.logs` labels on services (e.g., `gateway`, `postgrest`, `postgres`, `caddy`, `files`, `worker`). The Datadog agent container mounts Docker socket and reads these labels to tail stdout.
- Each service writes JSON logs to stdout; Datadog ingests them under the configured `service` name.

Service specifics

- Gateway

  - Initializes logger with service name `gateway` and wraps the reverse proxy with `RequestIDMiddleware`.
  - Logs token refresh attempts/results and file URL injection steps. Response modifiers attach refreshed tokens to headers.

- Files service

  - Initializes logger as `files`, exposes `/healthz` and `/signed_url` endpoints.
  - Logs request id (if present), input size, and the number of processed file items.

- Worker
  - Initializes logger as `worker`; logs lifecycle, dequeues, and per-task processing.
  - Appends operational errors to `queues.error` via SQL for durable audit, in addition to logs.

Operational notes

- Logs are the primary runtime signal; durable business/operational events are captured in Postgres (facts tables and `queues.error`).
- Correlation via `X-Request-ID` ties edge, gateway, and services together; background tasks have their own task‚Äêcentric logs with task ids.
