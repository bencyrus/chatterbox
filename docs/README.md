## Chatterbox Documentation

Status: current
Last verified: 2025-10-08

### Why this exists

- Provide a single, accurate entry point to the architecture and how to work within it.
- Keep links to deeper subsystem docs and style guides in one place.

### Role in the system

- Documentation overview for engineers building and operating Chatterbox.
- Defines how subsystems fit together and where to learn more.

### How it works

- Postgres‑first application: public API and business logic live in the database, exposed via PostgREST.
- Go services (gateway, worker, files) are thin and delegate business logic to SQL functions and supervisors.
- Workflows are orchestrated as supervisor‑driven processes: append‑only facts derive state; supervisors enqueue child tasks and may re‑enqueue themselves; the worker executes tasks.
