## Caddy (Reverse Proxy)

Status: current
Last verified: 2025-10-08

← Back to [`docs/README.md`](../README.md)

### Why this exists

- Provide a single public entrypoint that terminates TLS, assigns a correlation id, and routes all traffic to the gateway.
- Keep internal services private on the bridge network to reduce attack surface.

### Role in the system

- Internet-facing reverse proxy in front of the gateway.
- Adds a unique `X-Request-ID` to each request and forwards it upstream for end‑to‑end correlation.
- Emits JSON access logs to stdout for collection by the logging agent.

### How it works

- Caddyfile config

  Source: [`caddy/Caddyfile`](../../caddy/Caddyfile)

  ```
  example.com {
      header X-Request-ID {http.request.uuid}
      reverse_proxy gateway:8080 {
          header_up X-Request-ID {http.request.uuid}
      }
      log {
          output stdout
          format json
      }
  }
  ```

### AASA (Apple App Site Association) for Universal Links

- When using universal links on `glovee.io`, serve the AASA JSON at:
  - `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
  - `/apple-app-site-association`
- The Caddyfile includes static handlers that respond with JSON using env placeholders:
  - `AASA_APP_ID` = `<team_id>.<bundle_id>` (e.g., `12M3N4ZKYM.io.something.another`)
  - `AASA_PATHS` → path glob(s) (e.g., `/auth/magic*`)
- Provide these via an env file mounted to the Caddy service (e.g., `secrets/.env.caddy`).

- The `X-Request-ID` header is generated by Caddy and forwarded to the gateway. Go services read it via shared middleware and include it in structured logs.

  Source: [`shared/middleware/logging.go`](../../shared/middleware/logging.go)

  ```go
  // RequestIDMiddleware extracts the request ID from headers and adds it to the context
  func RequestIDMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
      return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          requestID := r.Header.Get("X-Request-ID")
          // ...
      })
  }
  ```

### Operations

- Ports: exposes `80` and `443` only; upstream gateway is on the private network.
- Logs: JSON access logs to stdout (collected by Datadog agent when enabled).
- Reload: update `caddy/Caddyfile` and restart/reload the container.

### Examples

- End‑to‑end correlation
  - Caddy sets and forwards `X-Request-ID`.
  - Gateway handlers read it via `RequestIDMiddleware` and log it using the shared logger.

### Future

- None at this time.
